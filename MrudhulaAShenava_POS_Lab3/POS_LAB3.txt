For Hydrogen Peroxide
Created an HAtom class where we check if there are at least 2 H atoms so that the program can be implemented once this condition satisfies and is true. If true the counter is set and the count is taken for H atoms that is 2 H atoms per water splash. There is a wait set up for the second H atom to be made once H atoms are implemented the O atoms wake up for implementation. Next, we take the OAtom class, in this we check if there are at least 2 O atoms so that the program can be implemented once this condition satisfies and is true. If true the counter is set and the count is taken for O atoms that is 2 O atoms per water splash. When H atoms are used we set the Hcount to ‘Hcount = Hcount – 2’ and Ocount to ‘Ocount - 2'. In sychronization we implement all the ready H atoms or the O atoms. So the atoms that are ready gets executed and side by side the corresponding atoms of either H or O will be getting ready to be implemented.
